# Vector
I wrote this in my Data Structures and Algorithms with C++ class in the Spring of 2020. The goal of this assignment was aimed at determining if we understood how a Vector works in the C++ STL "under-the-hood".
The methods for this file were given by my Instructor; however, I had to fill the methods in for this assignment.
